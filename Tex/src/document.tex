\section{Introduction}

\section{Preliminaries}
A module defines a set of abstract data types and a 
set of operations that may be invoked by
clients of the module. 
%A type consists of a set of fields of type boolean, integer or pointer to a user-defined type. 
The parameters and local variables 
of an operation are private to the
invocation of the operation. 
There are no static or global variables shared by  
different invocations of the operations. 
An operation is a sequence of atomic steps. 
Atomic step is either an operation on local 
variables or a load (``\code{x=y.f}'') or 
a store (``\code{x.f=y}'') operation on shared variables.

A configuration .. 
An execution is an alternating sequence of 
configurations and steps,
$C_0,s_1,\ldots,s_i,C_i,\ldots,$ 
where $C_i$ is the initial configuration,
and each configuration $C_i$ is the result of
executing step $s_i$ on configuration $C_{i-1}$.

\section{Global Version Algorithm}
Each write operation acquires a unique version 
from a global version object. Before every store step,  
the operation writes its unique version to the object.
