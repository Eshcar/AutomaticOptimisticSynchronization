\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:proof}


We argue that our transformation is \emph{correct}, in the sense that all the behaviors of 
the synthesized code are allowed by the original implementation.
In this section we provide informal correctness arguments; a formal proof is deferred to Appendix~\ref{sec:formal-proof}.

\paragraph{Indistinguishability of successful executions}
Every operation execution of the modified code starts at the beginning of the read-only phase and, 
(barring exceptions, deadlocks, or infinite loops, which will be discussed later), 
ends in a return statement in the update phase. The transition to the update phase 
from some location $\ell$ in the read-only phase first performs the validation phase successfully, then branches
to the matching point $\ell'$ in the update section. Note that the special case of falling back on the update phase in case of too
many validation failures is a branch from the starting location $S$ of the read-only phase, 
through an empty validation phase, to the starting point $S'$ of the update phase.

To show the correctness of such an execution, we argue that it is indistinguishable from an execution of the entire
operation using the instrumented update phase. Note that the latter essentially executes the original code, 
with the exception of updating version numbers, which have no effect in this phase.
%
The indistinguishability hinges on the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{The read-only phase has no side effects} since it does not modify shared state.
\item \emph{An unsuccessful validation phase has no lasting effect on shared state}, 
since it releases all locks it acquires. Moreover, it does not cause deadlock thanks to the use of tryLocks 
and releasing all locks	upon failure to acquire one. Since we assume that the update phase only uses 
blocking lock calls, the only impact an unsuccessful validation phase can have on it is additional waiting
on locks, which does not impact its behavior. 
\item  \emph{A successful validation phase executed after point $\ell$ in the read-only phase leads to 
an identical state as would have been reached by performing the (instrumented)
update phase from the beginning until point $\ell'$}.
\end{itemize}

While the first two properties can be directly observed from the code, the third requires more careful reasoning.
To understand why it is correct, recall that the read-only phase only reads shared state and does not modify it. 
The difference between the optimistic execution and the original one is that these reads are performed without 
holding a lock. We need to show that the execution is equivalent to one that would have acquired and released
locks as in the code of the update phase. First, we observe that we can perturb the original code to acquire each
such lock immediately before the first read of the object. We then distinguish between two cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In case the lock would have been released by original code before location $\ell$ is reached, 
we argue that the lock was free during the read-only phase from the time of the first read and at least until the time 
when it would have been released by the original code, implying that the execution is equivalent to one that would 
have held the lock in this period. This is because the successful validation means that (1) the object is currently
unlocked, and (2) object's version had not increased from the time it was read in the read-only phase, and until the 
validation phase, i.e., after it would have 
been released. Recall that in our instrumented code, the object's version increases every time it is locked.
\item In case the lock would have been held by the original code before location $\ell$, it is included in
the \emph{lockedSet} during the validation phase, and hence acquired before branching to the update phase.
As in the previous case, the successful validation of the \emph{readSet} ensures that the lock had been
available since the first read of the object.
\end{enumerate}

\Xomit{
We show  three properties of our automatic transformation. First, we prove that the  transformation is correct, i.e., 
every execution of the  synthesized code is equivalent to some execution of the \emph{locking algorithm}, that is, the
sequential code instrumented with the locking protocol.
This implies that if the locking protocol ensures serializability, then so does our protocol.
Second, we show that the equivalent execution preserves the real-time order of the original one, 
which implies that linearizability is also invariant under the transformation.
Finally, we argue that our transformation preserves deadlock-freedom.


\paragraph{Transformation Correctness}

Let $\pi$ be a finite execution of the transformed algorithm. We will show an equivalent execution of the locking algorithm.
Let \op\ be the set of operations in $\pi$.
First, we project object versions out of $\pi$'s configurations, and remove all accesses (reads and writes) to object versions.
That is, we replace steps that access versions with local steps that modify the operation's local memory only.
(Note that we get an execution with exactly the same invocations, responses, local states, and shared object states, but without 
versions). 
Second, note that each operation $op \in$ \op\ executes at most one successful read-only
phase, namely a complete read-only phase followed by a successful validation phase.
For each such $op$, we remove the prefix of $op$ that precedes the successful read-only phase.
This includes completely removing operations that have no successful read-only phase.
We call the resulting execution $\pi'$. It is easy to see that $\pi$ and $\pi'$ are equivalent,
since the removed failed read-only phases have no effect.

We next iteratively perturb $\pi'$ to construct an equivalent execution that satisfies the locking protocol.
We order the operations in \op\ according to the order in which the first steps of their 
respective (successful) read set validation phases occur in $\pi'$.
Denote the sequence of these first validations steps $e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_k$, and the respective operations
$op_1, op_2, \ldots, op_k$. Let $\pi_0 = \pi'$. 
In each iteration $i \geq 1$, we construct $\pi_i$ by replacing the execution of $op_i$
in $\pi_{i-1}$ with an execution of $op_i$ that follows the locking protocol. To do this, we first move all steps of $op_i$ that precede 
its first validation step, $e_i$, to occur immediately before $e_i$. We can move the reads to this point without affecting the read
values because the validation phase of $op_i$ succeeds, implying that these objects' values remain the same. 
 We then add steps that lock these objects before their read steps (and unlock
them) as dictated by the locking protocol.
%We then add steps that lock all of them immediately before these moved read
% steps. Finally, we add unlock steps immediately before $e_i$ for objects that are in the read set but not in the lock set during $e_i$, 
Finally we remove the tryLock and validation steps by $op_i$. 

Our ability to lock each object in $op_i$'s read set follows from the
observation that in $\pi$, no operation except $op_i$ locks an object in
$op_i$'s read set between the last time $op_i$ read the object in its
read-only phase and $op_i$'s first validation step (see Claim~\ref{claim:locks}). 
During the construction of $\pi_i$ we maintain
an invariant that all objects in the read set are not locked when $op_i$ needs
to lock them (Condition~\ref{cond:locks} in Lemma~\ref{lemma:pitagtag}).

% Our ability to lock each object in $op_i$'s read set follows from the following observation:
% \begin{observation}
% Between the first time in which $op_i$ first reads an object $obj$ in its read-only phase in $\pi'$, 
% and until the first step of $op_i$'s validation phase in $\pi'$, no thread locks $obj$. 
% \end{observation}
% The observation follows immediately from the fact that $op_i$'s read validation is successful and that every lock step increases the
% respective object's version number. Although in $\pi_{i-1}$ this may no longer hold, because some operation $op_j, j < i$ may 
% have locked $obj$, our construction of $\pi_{i-1}$ releases this lock before $e_i$, and hence $obj$ is available for locking. 

We formally prove in the appendix that $\pi'$ and $\pi_i$ are equivalent. 
By repeating this for all operations in \op, we get an execution $\pi_k$ of the locking protocol.

\paragraph{Real-Time Order}
It is easy to see that $\pi_k$ preserves the real-time order of $\pi$, since it does not change the order of invoke or return steps. 
}

\paragraph{Progress}
Finally, we argue that our read-only and validation phases do not generate spurious deadlocks, exceptions,
or infinite loops that were not present in the original code. In other words, if the original code would have
successfully completed with a return step, so does the instrumented code.

First, consider deadlocks.
The read and validation phases of our instrumented code do not use blocking locks -- the read-phase does not use locks at all, whereas the 
validation phase uses tryLocks. Therefore, both phases are non-blocking. In principle, the optimistic approach may lead to livelocks, but 
our algorithm fall-back on the pessimistic approach following a bounded number of restarts, and hence cannot livelock. We get that any lack
of progress must be due to blocking in the locking algorithm. Since the section of the code executing the locking protocol is unchanged, and
since we ensure that it begins when holding the same locks as in the original protocol, we get that our transformation does not introduce any
source of spurious blocking that is not present in the original locking protocol. 

Exceptions and infinite loops may be introduced in the read-only phase due to reading an inconsistent view of shared memory.
However, the fact that we perform validation both periodically and on exceptions means that we have a chance to detect these cases before they have any external impact. It remains to show that the validation phase fails in every situations where the read-only operation sees a view of shared memory that was impossible with the original code. And indeed, since we have argued above that the validation phase is successful only if the execution is equivalent to a lock-based one, it follows that in all other cases it fails, and hence the problematic situation is detected.
